# AI Models Module

## Overview
The AI Models Module is a web application designed to organize and present various AI models and their use cases. It aggregates data from reputable sources such as Hugging Face and Kaggle, providing users with easy access to information about AI models, datasets, and practical applications.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files and directories:

- **index.html**: The main HTML document for the AI Models Module, which includes the structure of the webpage, links to the CSS and JavaScript files, and sections for displaying AI models, use cases, and datasets.
- **README.md**: This documentation file provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, usage guidelines, and contribution information.
- **css/ai-models.css**: Contains styles for the AI Models Module, defining the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of the user interface.
- **data/huggingface-models.json**: A JSON file containing structured data about various AI models available on Hugging Face, including model names, descriptions, and relevant metadata.
- **data/kaggle-datasets.json**: A JSON file containing structured data about datasets available on Kaggle, including dataset names, descriptions, and relevant metadata.
- **data/use-cases.json**: A JSON file containing structured data about various AI use cases, detailing the applications of different models and datasets.
- **js/ai-models.js**: Contains JavaScript code that fetches data from the JSON files and dynamically displays it on the webpage. It includes functions for rendering the AI models, filtering by use case, and handling user interactions.
- **assets/icons**: A directory containing icon assets used throughout the module for visual representation and user interface enhancements.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the AI Models Module.
3. Ensure that the `data/huggingface-models.json`, `data/kaggle-datasets.json`, and `data/use-cases.json` files are populated with the latest data for accurate information.

## Usage Guidelines
- The main interface displays a list of AI models, datasets, and use cases categorized for easy navigation.
- Users can filter models and datasets based on specific use cases to find relevant information quickly.
- Each entry includes a name, description, and additional metadata for easy reference.
