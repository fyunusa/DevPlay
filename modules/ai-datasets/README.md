# AI Datasets Module

Welcome to the AI Datasets module! This project is designed to provide a comprehensive collection of datasets and models for various AI tasks, including Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision, Tabular Data, and Audio Processing.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories and files:

- **index.html**: The main entry point for the AI datasets module. It includes links to the CSS and JavaScript files and structures the layout for displaying various AI datasets and models.

- **css/**: Contains styles specific to the AI datasets module.
  - **ai-datasets.css**: Defines the visual appearance of the HTML elements, including layout, colors, fonts, and responsive design.

- **js/**: Contains the JavaScript code that handles the functionality of the AI datasets module.
  - **ai-datasets.js**: Includes functions to load and display datasets and models, manage user interactions, and possibly filter or search through the datasets.

- **datasets/**: Contains JSON files with information about various datasets.
  - **nlp.json**: Data related to natural language processing datasets.
  - **vision.json**: Data related to computer vision datasets.
  - **tabular.json**: Data related to tabular datasets.
  - **audio.json**: Data related to audio datasets.

- **models/**: Contains JSON files with information about various AI models.
  - **nlp-models.json**: Information about AI models used for natural language processing tasks.
  - **vision-models.json**: Information about AI models used for computer vision tasks.
  - **tabular-models.json**: Information about AI models designed for working with tabular data.
  - **audio-models.json**: Information about AI models used for audio processing tasks.

## Usage
