# Public APIs Module

## Overview
The Public APIs Module is a web application that provides a user-friendly interface for exploring various public APIs. The data is sourced from the [public-apis GitHub repository](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) and is presented in a structured format for easy access and interaction.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files and directories:

- **data/public-apis.json**: Contains the JSON representation of public APIs, including details such as API name, description, authentication type, and category.
- **css/public-apis.css**: Contains styles for the public APIs module, defining the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of the user interface.
- **js/public-apis.js**: Contains JavaScript code that fetches the public APIs data from the JSON file and dynamically displays it on the webpage. It includes functions for rendering the API list, filtering APIs by category, and handling user interactions.
- **index.html**: The main HTML document for the public APIs module, including the structure of the webpage, links to the CSS and JavaScript files, and a section for displaying the list of public APIs.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the Public APIs Module.
3. Ensure that the `data/public-apis.json` file is populated with the latest API data for accurate information.

## Usage Guidelines
